### DynStack - A Benchmarking Framework for Dynamic Stacking in Warehouse Operations

In this repository you find the simulation environments and policies to get started into benchmarking dynamic stacking problems. For more information on how to get started with running tests and benchmarks on your own machine, please refer to the documentation given at [simulation/README.md](simulation/README.md).

If you intend to do research using DynStack we refer to the following papers. We're happy to also include your paper, please contact us at dynstack@adaptop.at.
