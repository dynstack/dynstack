#### 2022-07 Internship Mitter

Maximilian Mitter worked as an intern with us from April-June 2022 and improved the competition frontend and implemented a lookahead-based policy. In his report he describes the approach and how he used HeuristicLab to optimize parameters for his policy. Read about his approach in his [internship report](publications/Internship%20Blog%20-%20HeuristicLab%20Mitter/Internship%20Blog%20-%20HeuristicLab%20Mitter.md).
